# 📊 Gold Insights (2020-2023) - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Overview
This project explores the **Gold Insights (2020-2023) dataset** sourced from Kaggle, analyzing global gold-related trends, sector-wise demand, and the correlation between gold reserves and economic indicators using **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**. Various visualizations and statistical insights are derived to understand gold's impact across different sectors.

## 📂 Dataset Features
✔️ **Gold Demand**: Jewelry, investment, technology, and central banks demand across multiple years.  
✔️ **Gold Reserves**: Country-wise gold holdings from 2020-2023.  
✔️ **Gold Jewelry Demand**: Demand trends across different countries.  
✔️ **Annual Demand by Country**: Yearly gold demand variations by nation.  

## 📊 Key Analyses & Visualizations
🔹 **Gold Demand Heatmap** → Visualizes yearly demand trends across multiple countries.  
🔹 **Gold Reserves Line Chart** → Displays fluctuations in central bank gold holdings.  
🔹 **Scatter Plot of Reserves vs Demand** → Explores the correlation between gold reserves and yearly demand.  
🔹 **Box Plot of Gold Price Volatility** → Analyzes fluctuations in gold prices over time.  
🔹 **Histogram of Yearly Demand Changes** → Shows the distribution of percentage change in gold demand.  

## 📜 Notable Findings
📌 **China and India** dominate global gold demand, with significant fluctuations over the years.  
📌 **Turkey** experienced one of the highest year-on-year percentage changes in demand.  
📌 **Countries with higher reserves don’t necessarily have the highest gold demand.**  
📌 **Gold demand for investment purposes surged during uncertain economic periods.**
