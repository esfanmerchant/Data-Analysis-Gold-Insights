# 📊 Gold Insights (2020-2023) - Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the "Gold Insights (2020-2023)" dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset provides a comprehensive view of gold-related trends, including demand, reserves, and jewelry consumption across different countries and time periods. Various data analysis techniques and visualizations are used to uncover insights about the role of gold in global economies.

## 📂 Dataset Features
✔️ **Gold Demand** (Yearly demand by country, sector-wise demand, and quarterly trends)
✔️ **Gold Reserves** (Central bank holdings of gold reserves by country)
✔️ **Gold Jewelry** (Country-wise demand for gold jewelry over the years)
✔️ **Economic Trends** (Year-on-year percentage changes in demand)

## 📊 Key Analyses & Visualizations
🔹 **Yearly Gold Demand Variation Across Countries** → Heatmap visualization
🔹 **Gold Demand Distribution & Trends** → Box plots for different countries
🔹 **Correlation Between Gold Reserves & Demand** → Scatter plot with regression line
🔹 **Gold Jewelry Demand Comparison** → Bar charts & grouped bar plots
🔹 **Year-on-Year % Change in Gold Demand** → Histogram analysis
🔹 **Gold Reserves Trends Across Top Countries** → Line chart visualization

## 📜 Notable Findings
📌 Countries like China and India exhibit the highest gold demand over the years.
📌 Central banks hold varying amounts of gold reserves, influencing market trends.
📌 A strong correlation exists between reserves and demand in some regions.
📌 Jewelry demand varies significantly, reflecting cultural and economic factors.
📌 Some regions experienced sharp increases or declines in demand due to economic fluctuations.
